# BIST-30-Forecasting-with-Time-Series


YOU CAN USE THIS PREDICTON CODES WITH YOUR ALL DATA'S, NOT ONLY WITH BIST-30.

STUDY TIME SERIES BEFORE USE THIS DOCUMENTS. I TRY TO HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND TIME SERIES AND THE FORCASTING.


Don't forget to execute sections in the python file one by one. Because there is different steps that you have to see which one is right for your estimation (If you know Time Series you can understand. I can't write here the information of Time Series estimations. Because it is a science and it may takes hundreds of pages.)

You can see all details about codes below:

1- Change the "datapath" with your datapath with the "XU030" document's path in your drive.
2- There is some visualize that shows all information about your data.
3- I didn't write some of explanation about some sections. If you will execute every part of code one by one, you will understand everything if you know "Time Series".


Plese don't hesitate to contact me.
